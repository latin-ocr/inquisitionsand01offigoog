Some notes from the Memoranda llolls and the Oriyr'aolz'o Rolls

conoerniug reliefs from laurls iu the counties of llssex and llertsord‚

although hardly within the scope of this work, have been printed

(pages 438-442) because they occur iu the Boolc of Area. 011 the
other hand, the leaves of that volume relating te Hertfordshire have
not been printed, because, although apparently normal, they prove to

be merely a transcript os the return of 1303.

The text of the present volume has been prepared partly by
Mr. A. S. llaskelyue and partly by Mr. J. V. Lyle, of the Publio
Reoord Offioe‚ and the Iudexes have been compileel by the latter.
