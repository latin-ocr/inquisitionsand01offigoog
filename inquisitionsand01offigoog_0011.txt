PREFAOE.

———-—

Tun scope of this work has been explained so fully in the Preface

to the F irst Volume that it is only necessary to add a few words

with regard to matters peculiar to this second instalment.

In connexion with Essex, it should be remarked that the account
os tbe Collectors of the Subsidy of 1428, in giving the names of
former tenants, goes back to the return os 1303, and ignores that
of 1346.

A Register of the Abbey of Llanthony by Gloucester‚ deposited
in the Public Record 0ffice, has proved very useful iu connexion
with Gloucestershire‚ as will be seen by reference to the. Table of
Materials used. A return printed therefrom on peges 244-255 bas
been assumed to belong to the year 1303 because of its similarity to
returns of that year from other counties. Certain additions to it in
a later hand, printed within square brackets, seem to have been made

in the first half of the F ifteenth Century.

A short retum (printed on peges rot-258), explicitly stated to
belong to the year 1303, was apparently of a special nature and
prepared by some one person, as the words inquirere potui occur
twice in it. Some writs and returns (printed on pages
259—263) relate also to the Aid for marrying the King's
daughter.
